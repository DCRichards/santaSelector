# Santa Selector

A simple secret santa picker written in [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).


## About

This project was born thanks to a combination of my excitement for Christmas and a desire to move outside of my Node.js comfort zone and start writing web applications and microservices in Python.

## Setup

    cd santaSelector
    pip install flask
    pip install flask-cors
    
To run, simply type:
    
    python run.py
